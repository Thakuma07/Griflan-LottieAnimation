# ✨ Guiding Light

> "Interaction that whispers, light that guides."

**Guiding Light** is a minimal, immersive web experience built with a focus on subtle user interaction. It features a reactive spotlight that follows the cursor, illuminating content only when approached, accompanied by a dynamic Lottie fire animation that trails the mouse movement with a smooth, eased follow-up.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🌫️ **Interactive Spotlight Mask**: A dynamic CSS radial gradient mask that reveals the content as the user moves their mouse.
- 🔥 **Lottie Cursor Trail**: A high-quality "Fire" animation (Lottie) that follows the cursor using custom easing logic.
- 🌊 **Smooth Scrolling**: Integrated with **Lenis** for a premium, buttery-smooth scrolling experience.
- 🎨 **Aesthetic Typography**: Uses the "Amarante" font for a mystical, elegant feel.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Fluid typography and layouts that adapt across different screen sizes.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. The Spotlight Mask
The "invisibility" is achieved through a CSS `radial-gradient` acting as a mask.
```css
.spotlight-mask {
    mask: radial-gradient(
        circle 220px at var(--mouse-x) var(--mouse-y),
        transparent 0%,
        transparent 40%,
        black 80%
    );
}
```
The `--mouse-x` and `--mouse-y` variables are updated in real-time via the JavaScript `animate()` loop.

### 2. Cursor Tracking Logic
To ensure smooth movement, the cursor position is calculated with easing:
```javascript
pos.mouse.current.x += (pos.mouse.target.x - pos.mouse.current.x) * 0.1;
pos.mouse.current.y += (pos.mouse.target.y - pos.mouse.current.y) * 0.1;
```
This prevents the "Fire" animation from snapping to the mouse, giving it a weightier, more fluid feel.

## ⚡ Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash

## 🖌️ Customization

- **Change Spotlight Size**: Modify the `220px` value in `styles.css` under `.spotlight-mask`.
- **Change Animation Speed**: Adjust the `0.1` multiplier in `script.js` inside the `animate()` function.
- **Switch Animations**: Replace `Fire.json` with any other Lottie JSON file in the root directory.
